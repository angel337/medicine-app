# MediMind

MediMind is a flutter medication reminder application for th elderly.
It aims to bridge the gap between the elderly and their caretakers in aiding them
taking their medications on time.


This application is using Flutter for its front-end through the platform of Android Studio.
To show and demo the app and external simulator has been used.
It used Firebase for it's backend and Node.js acts as the server to run batch jobs to 
return notifications to the users phone. 

The application also has the functionality that allows for a caretaker 
to be registered using their phone number.Then when the user account is set, the caretaker can be
assigned within the patient account by registering them with their phone number.

A pivotal step in ensuring that both the patient and the caretaker receives notification on the
basis of a 30 minute window on whether they have medications to take.

## Disclaimer
This application has been made to demonstrate learning
as a final year computer science student and is considered the final year project.

This app does not intend to replace any advice given by the medical industry
professionals.

This app does not contain any warning on either if the medication taken
should be taken with external attributes i.e with Alcohol, not mixed with other
medications so care should be taken when taking medications regardless.

Any simliaraties to charcters ficticous or real in the dataset and
application are mere coincidence and
are not at all intentional.
